<h1 id="windows-image-deployment-system">Windows Image Deployment System</h1>
<p>This project offers a robust solution for deploying Windows 10 images within enterprise environments, seamlessly integrating Microsoft SCCM, MDT, PDQ, and PowerShell scripts. IT technicians can utilize a web portal to efficiently manage the deployment process. By adding a machineâ€™s MAC address via the portal, technicians initiate the deployment process. Once the machine is connected to the network and configured for PXE boot, the system automatically initiates the deployment of a standardized Windows Standard Operating Environment (SOE) along with predefined applications. This ensures consistency in Windows builds and mitigates the risk of accidental deployments.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft SCCM and MDT Integration:</strong> Leveraging SCCM and MDT for image deployment and management ensures scalability and efficiency.</p>
